Hi,

Based on the init script explained in this [url="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1251896"]thread[/URL], i've developed a application that allows to plug and unplug folders like device disks.

Some devices have a external sdcard and a internal sdcard, and normally the apps are working with the internal sdcard.

With this application you can store your data in external sdcard and map in the desired folder in the internal sdcard (or another).
Until you desire, the files are available (for read and write) in the two folders (source and target).

The application detects the device boot and automatically mounts the configured mountpoints.
Also, it detects the device reboot and shutdown events and applies the umount commands.
Finally, it detects when a UMS connection is established (or finished) and umounts or remounts if needed.

The application requires root (in order to execute mount and umount operations)

I plan to publish a beta in 2-3 days (i'm finishing a few of tests), and I need a lot of testers :)

I attach screenshots of the application...
